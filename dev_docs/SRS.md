## 1\. Introduction {#1.-introduction}

### 1.1 Purpose {#1.1-purpose}

This Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document describes the functional and non-functional requirements for the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) of "**Gurukul**." This platform aims to provide a Udemy-like experience, allowing instructors to create and sell courses, and students to enroll and consume educational content. This document is intended to guide the developers through the design, development, and testing phases.

### 1.2 Document Conventions {#1.2-document-conventions}

Requirements are uniquely identified with a prefix (e.g., **FR-AUTH-001**). Priorities for MVP are implicitly high unless otherwise stated as post-MVP. The term "system" refers to **Gurukul**.

### 1.3 Intended Audience and Reading Suggestions {#1.3-intended-audience-and-reading-suggestions}

The primary audience for this document is the solo developer of the platform. It can also be used for understanding the validating and verifying the product while development. It is recommended to read the Overall Description (Section 2\) first, followed by Specific Requirements (Section 3\) and Non-Functional Requirements (Section 5).

### 1.4 Project Scope {#1.4-project-scope}

The scope of this MVP is to deliver a functional Learning Management System with core features enabling:

* User registration and authentication for Students and Instructors.  
* Instructors to create, structure (sections, lessons), upload video/text content, price, and publish courses.  
* Students can browse, search, enroll (free or paid), and consume course content, tracking their progress.  
* Integration with Razorpay for paid courses.  
* Basic administrative capabilities for user and course oversight.

Features explicitly out of scope for MVP include: advanced quizzing, certificates, discussion forums, live classes, advanced analytics beyond basic dashboards, affiliate programs, complex content dripping, and **advanced content moderation tools beyond basic admin unpublish/delete capabilities.**

## 2\. Overall Description {#2.-overall-description}

### 2.1 Product Perspective {#2.1-product-perspective}

**Gurukul** is a new, standalone web application. It will integrate with several third-party services:

* Clerk for user authentication and management.  
* Neon for data persistence (PostgreSQL).  
* Mux or Cloudinary for video hosting, processing, and streaming.

* Course creation including structuring content into sections and lessons (text, video).  
* Course pricing and publishing by instructors.  
* Course discovery, browsing, and search for students.  
* Course enrollment (free and paid).  
* Secure content delivery and consumption.  
* Basic course progress tracking.  
* Payment processing for paid courses.  
* Basic administrative dashboard and user/course management.
